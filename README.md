# Sweet.uBuild

uBuild provides an alternative to configuring build options without using Unityâ€™s default player settings.

Build settings are created as individual assets inside the project structure, allowing for quick and consistent switching between different configurations without requiring error prone hand tweaking.

Once setup, objects can be easily pushed to any source control system ensuring consistent build results between all developers, including those unfamiliar with the build process.

Build objects can also easily be run through command line batch mode for easy integration with existing continuous integration workflows.
